- What is 'far right'?
- Course structure
    <!-- + no class on 1 May and 29 May (holidays), topics covered in prior and subsequent sessions -->
        <!-- - any assignment submission requirements remain the same -->
- Learning aims
- What the course is not...

## First task...

[Read the syllabus!]{style="font-size:120px;"}

<!-- <div style="font-size: 50px;">Read the syllabus!</div> -->

- We have a shiny new (developing) website for the course
    + <https://michaelzeller.de/course-fr/>

- Before our next meeting, your task is to peruse the website
    + especially the [Syllabus]{style="color:red;"}, [Schedule]{style="color:red;"}, and [Report example]{style="color:red;"} pages. 

## Defining 'far right'

- Broadly: a **[noun]{style="color:red;"}** or **[adjective]{style="color:red;"}** referring to phenomena that reject (at least elements of) _liberalism_ and/or _democracy_, and is characterised by 
[nationalism]{style="color:cadetblue;"}, [exclusionism]{style="color:cadetblue;"}, [xenophobia]{style="color:cadetblue;"}, [strong state]{style="color:cadetblue;"}, [welfare chauvinism]{style="color:cadetblue;"}, [traditional ethics]{style="color:cadetblue;"}, [authoritarianism]{style="color:cadetblue;"}, and/or [populism]{style="color:cadetblue;"}

. . .

- [Radical]{style="color:red;"} right (populist and non-populist cases): opposition to fundamental values of liberal democracy (radical) and belief in a natural order with inequalities (right)

- [Extreme]{style="color:red;"} right: rejection of democracy (Ignazi's 'antisystem'---but that depends on the system)

. . .

- __[far right]{style="color:red;"}__ encompasses both these terms

## Publications on radical right (from [Arzheimer](https://www.kai-arzheimer.com/tag/bibliography/))

![From Arzheimer's bibliography: <https://www.kai-arzheimer.com/tag/bibliography/>](slide_files/01/radical_right_pubs.png)

## Idea of the research field (Arzheimer, 2022)

![Wordfish from Arzheimer's bibliography: Y-axis - how likely the appearance of a word is in research on far right; x-axis - strength of association of a word with underlying dimension](slide_files/01/wordfish-beta-april-2022.png)

## Holidays

Several holidays overlap with our class meetings:   

- 1 May (Class 2)
- 29 May (Class 6)
- 19 June (Class 9) 

**FOR NOW, no make-up classes are planned...**   

- requires attentive reading and preparation so we can cover the material in the surrounding classes
- possibly adding short recorded lectures...

## Aims

- knowledge about past and contemporary far-right political and social activity
- familiarity with breadth of research literature covering the far right
- Capacity to...
    * assess developments in far-right socio-politics, especially by identifying underlying factors and comparing across contexts
    * critically evaluate research on the far right, especially by evaluating the data and methods used
    * gather, assess, and present data about far-right socio-politics

## What the course is not...

<!-- - neither training in nor forum for activism against the far right -->
- [not for activism against the far right]{style="color:red;"}
    * it's a seminar, like many others, with real-world implications

. . .

- [not for airing grievances about far right and caricaturing far-right supporters]{style="color:red;"}
    * good research on the far right takes seriously its ideology, organisations, and supporters---and tries to divorce analysis from normative commitments

. . .

- [not for dogmatic positions about far-right activity]{style="color:red;"}
    * we will respectfully debate---and likely disagree at several points---about what qualifies as far right, how it should be researched and understood, and what to do with the fruits of research

## Connection to Vorlesung

This seminar is connected to **Prof. Dr. Berthold Rittberger**’s lecture *(Vorlesungsübung: The Political System of the European Union)*

- is everyone enrolled in that?
- we will tie in Prof. Rittberger's content through class discussions
<!-- - we will tie in Prof. Rittberger's content through student presentations -->

## Course assessment

```{r requirements, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
# col1 <- c("","Attendance & Participation","Presentation","Essay"),
kable(data.frame(
  col1 <- c("","Participation","Presentation","Essay","Exercise","Klausur"),

                            font_size = 30)
```

## Participation

- do the readings and discuss in class <!-- limit electronic devices in class -->
- make note of any questions or comments you have as you go through the readings
- most of the readings are research journal articles
    + more in-depth than book chapters---requires greater concentration
    + consider complementing with a general reader (examples listed at of [Syllabus](https://michaelzeller.de/course-fr/syllabus/))

## Presentation (*Referat*)

- short (max. 20 mins.) group presentation on a method
- groups, topics, and preferred date due to me by [Week 4 (15 May)]{style="color:red;"}
    + but there are advantages to booking early...

## Essay (*Hausarbeit*): Data report

- data report on a far-right phenomenon (e.g., voters, a party, protests, violence)
- gather and present data, generate analytical insights
- 2500-3500 words (excluding citations)
- [28 June]{style="color:red;"}: short synopsis due. [16 August]{style="color:red;"}: full, final report due. 
- consider working with data visualisation and analysis software!

<!-- ## Exercise (*Übungsaufgabe*) - only pedagogy students -->

<!-- - memo on an assigned far-right actor (e.g., a party, movement, or organisation) -->
<!-- - basic description and any important context, gather and present relevant data (e.g., a memo on a party might present their election results in the last five national elections; on a movement, a string of protest events), importance of this data and far-right actor -->
<!-- - topic assigned right after class on [3 July]{style="color:red;"} --- due on [9 July]{style="color:red;"} -->
<!-- - 1000-2000 words -->
<!-- - I will offer suggestions about useful sources for your assigned topic -->
<!-- - **Klausur** -->
<!--     + 90-minutes exam in essay form, by arrangement -->

# Onto our topic: concept formation and conceptualising the far right {background-color="#2c844c"}

- fundamentals of social science concepts
- Mudde's approach for the far right

## Concept formation

- **concepts** are the building blocks of social science research
    + a term denoting an abstract idea

![](slide_files/01/Munck_data_aggregation.png)

## Concept formation

- identifying bounds of concepts <!-- Sartori's extension (denotation) and intension (connotation) -->
    * See @Sartori1970
- broadly, three types of concepts in social science

. . . 

1. [classical]{style="color:red;"}: **all** criteria are shared by **all** cases

. . . 

2. [radial]{style="color:red;"}: **some** criteria are shared by **all** cases; others are not

. . . 

3. [family resemblance]{style="color:red;"}: **No** criterion is shared by **all** cases

## Visualising classical/radial concepts

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

```

::: {.column width="50%"}
Radial concept (all share 'female')
```{r, fig.width=5}
#| label: venn2
#| eval: true
venn(4, snames = "female, 50% of genes, married to father, nurtures", sncs = 1.1)

and family resemblance: no characteristics shared by all (e.g., games)

## Classical vs. radial [@collier1993ConceptualStretchingRevisited]

![](slide_files/01/CollierMahon_classical_radial.png)

```{r out.height='100%'}
#| eval: false
#| include: false
knitr::include_graphics(rep("slide_files/01/CollierMahon_classical_radial.png"))
```


## Options (according to Mudde)

1. family resemblance 
<!-- + "none of the parties are exactly the same, but each family member will have some features in common with all other members" -->

. . . 

2. Weber's ideal type 
    <!-- + must satisfy all characteristics -->

. . . 

3. _Primus inter pares_ ('first among equals'): one example that sets the model for all others

. . . 

4. lowest common denominator: group on the basis of the (few) features that all individual members have in common. This would lead to a so-called “minimum definition” (cf. Eatwell 1996)

. . .

5. greatest common denominator: a “maximum definition,” maximise possible number of similarities within (part of) the family
    
<!-- the “greatest common denominator” and employs a “most similar system design” (Przeworksi & Teune 1970), i.e. similarities among a selection of party family members from backgrounds as similar as possible. The aim is to find a “maximum definition,” possible number of similarities within (part of) the family (see Mudde 2000a) -->

<!-- Mudde uses approaches 2 and 3, prefering their 'classical rather than radial' nature -->

## Ideological components

- nationalism
- exclusionism
- xenophobia
- strong state
- welfare chauvinism
- traditional ethics

\hspace{10mm} &darr;

- __nativism__
- __authoritarianism__
- __populism__

<!-- what do you think? does this make sense? are potentially important components missing ('ethnopluralism'?)? what are some problems of focusing on ideological components? (TALK ABOUT PREO) -->

## Radical and extreme

Again...

> [Radical]{style="color:red;"} right (populist and non-populist cases): opposition to fundamental values of liberal democracy (radical) and belief in a natural order with inequalities (right)

> [Extreme]{style="color:red;"} right: rejection of democracy (Ignazi's 'antisystem'---but that depends on the system)

> __[far right]{style="color:red;"}__ encompasses both these terms

## Radical and extreme

![From: Arzheimer, Kai. “Conceptual Confusion is not Always a Bad Thing: The Curious Case of European Radical Right Studies.” Demokratie und Entscheidung. Eds. Marker, Karl, Michael Roseneck, Annette Schmitt, and Jürgen Sirsch. Wiesbaden: Springer, 2018. 23-40.](slide_files/01/er-rr-timeseries.png)

## Examples?

What cases are you familiar with?

How should we categorise them and why?

## Examples - talking through (party) cases

| **Radical**                    | **Extreme**               |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **AfD**                        | Der Flügel?               |
| **FPÖ**                        | NPD                       |
| **UKIP?**                      | British National Party    |
| **RN/Front National**          | Britain First             |
| **PiS/United Right**           | Casa Pound                |
| **Fidesz**                     | Mi Hazánk Mozgalom        |
| **FdI, Lega, Forza Italia?**   | Golden Dawn               |
| **Partij voor de Vrijheid**    |                           |

even trickier with movements?

## Points to be aware of?

- concept formation
- measurement
- methods
- descriptive vs. causal inference
- generalisation
