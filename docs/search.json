    "text": "For general guidance, please see the academic writing guidance provided by the university: https://www.en.ub.uni-muenchen.de/writing/academic-writing/index.html. All writing benefits from feedback and revision, so try to write and then revise your work. Beyond that guidance, the university has a Writing Center (https://www.en.schreibzentrum.fak13.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) that offers students help.\nStudents wishing to improve their writing may find it helpful to consult guides on writing style, such as:\nOrwell, G. (1946). Politics and the English Language. The Orwell Foundation: https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/.1\nStrunk, W. & White, E.B. (1999). The Elements of Style. Pearson.\nUse a citation management software to organise your papers and create bibiliographies. Zotero is particularly good because it is free, open source, and works across multiple operating systems.\nIf you are considering a career in research, you may find it helpful to familiarise yourself with typesetting programmes commonly used for research output, such as Markdown documents in the R programming environment (RStudio is a good tool for R) or (TexStudio is a good tool for )."

This presentation should be informed by material from Prof. Dr. Berthold Rittberger’s lecture (15026 Vorlesungsübung: The Political System of the European Union). The presentation should introduce an area of EU politics, present a piece of research (i.e., a journal article or research report) that deals with the far right in this area of EU politics, and then lead a short class discussion about the conclusions and significance (e.g., for voters in EU elections) of this research and area of political activity. Students may choose any quality published research for their presentation material, though the instructor may suggest students focus on some other piece of research.\nStudents are responsible for creating their own group and organising their presentation. The date of presentation will be agreed with the instructor and, wherever possible, arranged so that no more than one group presents per class meeting."

    "text": "Essay (Hausarbeit)\nStudents that are required by their degree programme to write a final essay will write an analytical report on a far-right phenomenon, such as voting for far-right parties in Europe (or in a specific country) or far-right protest activity or far-right violence. The report should be 3000-4000 words (excluding citations). It should briefly introduce the subject, briefly discuss relevant research literature, and (particularly important) should gather and present (in a tablular and/or graphic format) some data relevant to understanding the far-right phenomenon (e.g., a report on a party might present their election results; a report on a movement might present the protest events they have organised during a specific period of time). Please note that introduction and literature review are to be brief. The intention of this report is for you to gather data and generate analytical insights. Imagine that you are describing this far-right phenomenon to someone (a policymaker or researcher) with no specific knowledge of it; your job is to provide context briefly, offer specific knowledge, and why that knowledge is important.\nStudents are generally free to choose their topic and have it confirmed by the instructor—though the instructor may veto a topic and assign another, or ask the student to choose another. By the middle of the semester, students should have started their data collection and should submit a draft dataframe: this (most likely) will be an Excel file with your variables in columns and observations in rows. The instructor will check it and offer any necessary guidance about completing data collection. Prior to the end of the semester, students intending to write the essay should submit a short synopsis that states your topic, lists some relevant research sources, describes the parameters of the data (i.e., variables, number of observations—think of writing up a mini-codebook) and its presentation (i.e., how you will present it in your report), and identifies any particular points on which you need preliminary feedback. (This is your chance to get risk-free feedback on your work. Embrace it!) Feedback on the synopsis may direct students to revise their topic, focus on other sources, and/or reconsider their data approach to their proposed report.\nDeadline for draft dataframe submission: 2025-06-14\nDeadline for short synopsis submission: 2025-07-05\nDeadline for full report submission (including full dataframe): 2025-08-16\nUnder exceptional circumstances, the instructor may accept late submissions due to unforeseen circumstances. Generally, late submissions will be marked down 0,3 for every two days it is not submitted. If foreseen circumstances make the deadline impossible, please speak to the instructor to make an alternative arrangement.\nFinally, a suggested (purely voluntary, but perhaps to your ultimate benefit) mode of conducting work on your report: students may find it advantageous to work in R and Rstudio. This is a powerful data management and analysis tool. It combines the capability to import and visualise data, conduct sophisticated analyses, and even present them in nicely formatted documents (whether Word, PDF, or HTML). Students interested in working with datasets in their theses, going on to advanced academic studies, or pursuing a career in research will benefit enormously from engaging with this tool early and often. The course introduction will provide some tips for using this tool. For further information, please turn to the vast material related to online or inquire with the instructor."

This begins with understanding that ‘far right’ is a contested term used to describe an indeterminate and diverse set of cases. We will look at how research (and by extension, law and policy) has variously defined far right. We will look at the ideology that serves to motivate organisations and actors we encounter later in the course. This part will help students to evaluate published work on far-right politics and protest, and to situate their own research within relevant conceptual frameworks."

To make this transition, we consider the liminal cases that are often called ‘movement-parties’ and, more broadly, consider the relationship between far-right movements and aligned parties. In the sphere of social mobilisation and movement activism, how does far-right activity manifest? Are far-right movements akin to other social movements or some sui generis category? How do other movement actors respond to the far right and to what effect? And why and how do far-right movements falter, fail, and demobilise? These questions take us into a dynamic and highly active field of contemporary research."

How do individuals become involved in far-right activity? What violent manifestations arise from radicalisation into right-wing extremism? And how have new modes of communication and relation on the Internet effected far-right activity? These questions, these classes take up some of the most menacing aspects of the far right and consider whether online tools have significantly changed the conditions of far-right activity."

The presentation should introduce an area of EU politics, present a piece of research (i.e., a journal article or research report) that deals with the far right in this area of EU politics, and then lead a short class discussion about the conclusions and significance (e.g., for voters in EU elections) of this research and area of political activity. Students may choose any quality published research for their presentation material, though the instructor may suggest students focus on some other piece of research.\nStudents are responsible for creating their own group and organising their presentation.

    "text": "Essay (Hausarbeit)\nStudents that are required by their degree programme to write a final essay will write an analytical report on a far-right phenomenon, such as voting for far-right parties in Europe (or in a specific country) or far-right protest activity or far-right violence. The report should be 3000-4000 words (excluding citations). It should briefly introduce the subject, briefly discuss relevant research literature, and (particularly important) should gather and present (in a tablular and/or graphic format) some data relevant to understanding the far-right phenomenon (e.g., a report on a party might present their election results; a report on a movement might present the protest events they have organised during a specific period of time). Please note that introduction and literature review are to be brief. The intention of this report is for you to gather data and generate analytical insights. Imagine that you are describing this far-right phenomenon to someone (a policymaker or researcher) with no specific knowledge of it; your job is to provide context briefly, offer specific knowledge, and why that knowledge is important.\nStudents are generally free to choose their topic and have it confirmed by the instructor—though the instructor may veto a topic and assign another, or ask the student to choose another. By the middle of the semester, students should have started their data collection and should submit a draft dataframe: this (most likely) will be an Excel file with your variables in columns and observations in rows. The instructor will check it and offer any necessary guidance about completing data collection. Prior to the end of the semester, students intending to write the essay should submit a short synopsis that states your topic, lists some relevant research sources, describes the parameters of the data (i.e., variables, number of observations—think of writing up a mini-codebook) and its presentation (i.e., how you will present it in your report), and identifies any particular points on which you need preliminary feedback. (This is your chance to get risk-free feedback on your work. Embrace it!) Feedback on the synopsis may direct students to revise their topic, focus on other sources, and/or reconsider their data approach to their proposed report.\nDeadline for draft dataframe submission: 2025-06-14\nDeadline for short synopsis submission: 2025-07-05\nDeadline for full report submission (including full dataframe): 2025-08-16\nUnder exceptional circumstances, the instructor may accept late submissions due to unforeseen circumstances. Generally, late submissions will be marked down 0,3 for every two days it is not submitted. If foreseen circumstances make the deadline impossible, please speak to the instructor to make an alternative arrangement.\nFinally, a suggested (purely voluntary, but perhaps to your ultimate benefit) mode of conducting work on your report: students may find it advantageous to work in R and Rstudio. This is a powerful data management and analysis tool. It combines the capability to import and visualise data, conduct sophisticated analyses, and even present them in nicely formatted documents (whether Word, PDF, or HTML). Students interested in working with datasets in their theses, going on to advanced academic studies, or pursuing a career in research will benefit enormously from engaging with this tool early and often. The course introduction will provide some tips for using this tool. For further information, please turn to the vast material related to online or inquire with the instructor."

We will look at the ideology that serves to motivate organisations and actors we encounter later in the course.

    "text": "PART III - Far-right movements\nIn this set of class sessions, we will shift our focus from political parties to movement actors. To make this transition, we consider the liminal cases that are often called ‘movement-parties’ and, more broadly, consider the relationship between far-right movements and aligned parties. In the sphere of social mobilisation and movement activism, how does far-right activity manifest? Are far-right movements akin to other social movements or some sui generis category? How do other movement actors respond to the far right and to what effect? And why and how do far-right movements falter, fail, and demobilise? These questions take us into a dynamic and highly active field of contemporary research."

In this course, we will discuss the terms and conceptualisations used to study the far right and their manifestations in far-right parties and voters, mobilisation and movements, online activity, and political violence. We will consider explanations for the rise and success as well as decline and failure of the far right across these areas. Crucially, this course will cover these topics from a comparative perspective, underscoring the commonalities and variations between different contexts. In addition to considering the empirical substance of far-right phenomena, students will be encouraged to scrutinise the methodological tools applied in studies of the far right, to evaluate how well a particular methodology is answering a given research question. Taken together, students in this course will acquire knowledge about far-right activity in diverse social sphere and will hone analytical skills used to research and evaluate the far right."
