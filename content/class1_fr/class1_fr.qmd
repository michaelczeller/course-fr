## Defining 'far right'

- Broadly: **a _noun_ or _adjective_ referring to phenomena that reject (at least elements of) _liberalism_ and/or _democracy_, and is characterised by _nationalism_, _exclusionism_, _xenophobia_, _strong state_, _welfare chauvinism_, _traditional ethics_, _authoritarianism_, and/or _populism_**

- **Radical right** (populist and non-populist cases)
    + opposition to fundamental values of liberal democracy (radical) and belief in a natural order with inequalities (right)

- **Extreme right**
    + rejection of democracy (Ignazi's 'antisystem'---but that depends on the system)

- __far right__ encompasses both these terms

## Idea of the research field (Arzheimer, 2022)

\vspace{-10mm}

![Wordfish from Arzheimer's bibliography: Y-axis - how likely the appearance of a word is in research on FR; x-axis - strength of association of a word with underlying dimension](wordfish-beta-april-2022.png)

## Aims

- knowledge about past and contemporary far-right political and social activity
- familiarity with breadth of research literature covering the far right
- Capacity to...
    * assess developments in far-right socio-politics, especially by identifying underlying factors and comparing across contexts
    * critically evaluate research on the far right, especially by evaluating the data and methods used

## What the course is not...

- neither training in nor forum for activism against the far right
    * it's a seminar, like many others, with real-world implications
- not a place for airing grievances about the far right and caricaturing its supporters
    * good research on the far right takes seriously its ideology, organisations, and supporters---and tries to divorce analysis from normative commitments
- dogmatic positions about far-right acitivity
    * we will respectfully debate---and likely disagree at several points---about what qualifies as far right, how it should be researched and understood, and what to do with the fruits of research

## Connection to Vorlesung

This seminar is connected to **Prof. Dr. Berthold Rittberger**’s lecture *(15026 Vorlesungsübung: The Political System of the European Union)*

- is everyone enrolled in that?
- we will tie in Prof. Rittberger's content through student presentations

## Course assessment

```{r requirements, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
# col1 <- c("","Attendance & Participation","Presentation","Essay"),
kable(data.frame(
  col1 <- c("","Participation","Presentation","Essay","Exercise","Klausur"),
  col2 <- c("BA main","X","X","X","",""),
  col3 <- c("BA minor (60)","X","X","X","",""),
  col4 <- c("BA minor (30)","X","X (or Exercise)","","X (or Presentation)",""),
  col5 <- c("Pedagogy","X","X (or Exercise)","","X (or Presentation)","X"),
  col6 <- c("Exchange","X","X","X","","")),
  col.names = NULL, align = c("l","c","c","c","c","c")) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position",
                            bootstrap_options = "bordered",
                            font_size = 7)
```

- **Participation** - do the readings and discuss in class <!-- limit electronic devices in class -->
- **Presentation** (*Referat*)
    + short (max. 20 mins.) group presentation introducing EU politics area, present a piece of research on the far right in this area of EU politics
    + groups, topics, and presentation date due to me by **\textcolor{red}{16 May}**---but there are advantages to booking early...
- **Essay**
    + report on a far-right phenomenon (e.g., voters, a party, protests, violence)
    + gather and present data, generate analytical insights
    + 3000-4000 words (excluding citations)
    + **\textcolor{red}{14 June}**: draft dataframe due. **\textcolor{red}{5 July}**: short synopsis due. **\textcolor{red}{16 August}**: full, final report due. 
    + consider working with data visualisation and analysis software!

## Course assessment

```{r requirements-repeat, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
# col1 <- c("","Attendance & Participation","Presentation","Essay"),
kable(data.frame(
  col1 <- c("","Participation","Presentation","Essay","Exercise","Klausur"),

                            font_size = 7)
```

- **Exercise**
    + memo on an assigned far-right actor (e.g., a party, movement, or organisation)
    + basic description and any important context, gather and present relevant data (e.g., a memo on a party might present their election results in the last five national elections; on a movement, a string of protest events), importance of this data and far-right actor
    + topic assigned right after class on **\textcolor{red}{4 July}** --- due on **\textcolor{red}{10 July}**
    + 1000-2000 words
    + I will offer suggestions about useful sources for your assigned topic
- **Klausur**
    + 90-minutes exam in essay form, by arrangement

## For the paper, and writing in general...

![Patriotta, G. (2017). Crafting papers for publication: Novelty and convention in academic writing. *Journal of Management Studies, 54*(5), 747-759.](crafting_papers_for_publication.png)

It is feasible that final papers could provide a start for a research publication. For those interested in research careers, this should be kept in mind.

## Typical class meeting

- Opening question(s)/discussion point(s)
    + e.g., theoretical dilemma, typology forming, item from the news
- Short summarising lecture on theory/findings related to week's topic
- Discussion point
- Discussing the reading(s)
    + highlighting important points (especially theory and research design)
        * _students who do the reading will find this discussion most illuminating_
- Presentation of further research relevant to week's topic
    + _another reason to attend class: this further research might help you on your assignments_
- Summative discussion: takeaways, new ideas, lingering questions

\vspace{5mm}

**Throughout, we will use _cases_ (especially the cases you are familiar with) to link _theory_ to _real-world events_.**


## Office hours and communication

# Onto our topic: concept formation and conceptualising the far right

## Concept formation

- **concepts** are the building blocks of social science research
    + a term denoting an abstract idea

![](Munck_data_aggregation.png)

## Concept formation

- identifying bounds of concepts <!-- Sartori's extension (denotation) and intension (connotation) -->
    * See @Sartori1970
- broadly, three types of concepts in social science
    + \underline{classical}: **all** criteria are shared by **all** cases
    + \underline{radial}: **some** criteria are shared by **all** cases; others are not
    + \underline{family resemblance}: **No** criterion is shared by **all** cases

<!-- and family resemblance, where no characteristics are shared all -->

<!-- \textbf{other examples?} -->

## Mudde's approach

Options

1. family resemblance <!-- "none of the parties are exactly the same, but each family member will have some features in common with all other members" -->
2. Weber's ideal type 
3. _Primus inter pares_ <!-- one example that sets the model for all others -->
4. lowest common denominator <!-- group on the basis of the (few) features that all individual members have in common. This would lead to a so-called “minimum definition” (cf. Eatwell 1996). -->
5. greatest common denominator <!-- the “greatest common denominator” and employs a “most similar system design” (Przeworksi & Teune 1970), i.e. similarities among a selection of party family members from backgrounds as similar as possible. The aim is to find a “maximum definition,” possible number of similarities within (part of) the family (see Mudde 2000a) -->

<!-- Mudde uses approaches 2 and 3, prefering their 'classical rather than radial' nature -->

## Ideological components

- nationalism
- exclusionism
- xenophobia
- strong state
- welfare chauvinism
- traditional ethics

\hspace{10mm} &darr;

- __nativism__
- __authoritarianism__
- __populism__

<!-- what do you think? does this make sense? are potentially important components missing ('ethnopluralism'?)? what are some problems of focusing on ideological components? (TALK ABOUT PREO) -->

## Radical and extreme

Radical right (populist and non-populist cases)

- opposition to fundamental values of liberal democracy (radical) and belief in a natural order with inequalities (right)

Extreme right

- rejection of democracy (Ignazi's 'antisystem'---but that depends on the system)

And __far right__ encompasses them both

## Radical and extreme

## Points to be aware of?

- concept formation
- measurement
- methods
- descriptive vs. causal inference
- generalisation
